# Font checker

This page helps developers find out which default fonts are available in their machine and how they render in the browser.

## How to use it

Just load the page, choose a font size (or leave the default) and, if you want, an additional text.

You will see the list of fonts, each rendered with the font itself.

## Warning

The page is clearly kept as simple as possible, with no obtrusive layout. 
Also, the fonts are loaded following this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3368837/list-every-font-a-users-browser-can-display) by Chris.
